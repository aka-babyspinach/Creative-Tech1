      <h1 style="font: size 18px;">"Such alternatives do not always replace the existing systems, nor are they often intended to. Instead, these material interventions provide insubstantiations of how the relationship between society and technology might be otherwise constructed."</h1>
      
      <p style="font: size 16px;">It is really interesting that the writer bring up this point of open design alternatives are not here to replace the existing system rather than offering another possibility to it. Does design is defined as design when the intention is not trying to solve the problems? Moreover, what does it mean when an alternative or an open design offer an entirely possible and achievable solution, hence successfully replaced the existed system?</p> 
      
      
     <h1 style="font: size 18px;"> "Critical making, on the other hand, is less about the aesthetics AESTHETICS: 2D and politics of design work, and focuses instead on making practices themselves as processes of material and conceptual exploration."</h1>
      
      <p style="font: size 16px;">I wonder how the writer define aesthetics in his article. In my opinion, aesthetics does not necessarily indicate having a beautiful and polished facade, but rather an appearance that communicates meanings and functions which sometimes happen to be aesthetically pleasing. In addition, even though I personally do not prefer the work that exclusively focus on design aesthetics, I cannot deny the power of style and trends, as well as how people are so easily swayed by attractive design aesthetics. Not to mention the fact that the “ intentionally unrefined ugly style” gradually comes in fashion as the trend of recent years. Therefore, I wonder if we can ever work pass the emphasis on aesthetics and exhibit our concept experimentation without considering the aesthetics of it. </p>
        
        
     <h1 style="font: size 18px;"> "These are fine-edged distinctions and might cause some readers to wonder why it is necessary to define yet another term for yet another design-based methodology. In point of fact, much of the ongoing scholarly and technical work associated with critical making was initiated by discomfort around the dissonance of the term – why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us?"</h1>
      
      <p style="font: size 16px;;">This quote really reflects what I have been contemplating recently. When a work of design is perfectly functional and beautiful, we often overlook the implication and the underlying context beyond its facade. Since we often confuse the good design with critical design, I think it is also important to draw the line between good design and critical design, but also where exactly should we draw the line. I also wonder what defines critical design? And can a design poses controversial even oppositional point of view be seen as critical design.
