        <h3>"Such alternatives do not always replace the existing systems, nor are they often
            intended to. Instead, these material interventions provide insubstantiations of how the relationship between
            society and technology might be otherwise constructed."</h3>

            <p>It is really interesting that the writer bring up this point of open design alternatives
                are not here to replace the existing system rather than offering another possibility to it. Does design
                is
                defined as design when the intention is not trying to solve the problems? Moreover, what does it mean
                when an
                alternative or an open design offer an entirely possible and achievable solution, hence successfully
                replaced
                the existed system?</p>


            <h3> "Critical making, on the other hand, is less about the aesthetics AESTHETICS: 2D and
                politics of design work, and focuses instead on making practices themselves as processes of material and
                conceptual exploration."</h3>

                <p>I wonder how the writer define aesthetics in his article. In my opinion, aesthetics does
                    not necessarily indicate having a beautiful and polished facade, but rather an appearance that
                    communicates
                    meanings and functions which sometimes happen to be aesthetically pleasing. In addition, even though
                    I
                    personally do not prefer the work that exclusively focus on design aesthetics, I cannot deny the
                    power of style
                    and trends, as well as how people are so easily swayed by attractive design aesthetics. Not to
                    mention the fact
                    that the “ intentionally unrefined ugly style” gradually comes in fashion as the trend of recent
                    years.
                    Therefore, I wonder if we can ever work pass the emphasis on aesthetics and exhibit our concept
                    experimentation
                    without considering the aesthetics of it. </p>


                <h3> "These are fine-edged distinctions and might cause some readers to wonder why it is
                    necessary to define yet another term for yet another design-based methodology. In point of fact,
                    much of the
                    ongoing scholarly and technical work associated with critical making was initiated by discomfort
                    around the
                    dissonance of the term – why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while
                    ‘critical
                    making’ seems odd to most of us?"</h3>

                    <p>This quote really reflects what I have been contemplating recently. When a work of
                        design is perfectly functional and beautiful, we often overlook the implication and the
                        underlying context
                        beyond its facade. Since we often confuse the good design with critical design, I think it is
                        also important to
                        draw the line between good design and critical design, but also where exactly should we draw the
                        line. I also
                        wonder what defines critical design? And can a design poses controversial even oppositional
                        point of view be
                        seen as critical design.

        <h3>It thus becomes an assertion of individual defiance of social norms. The byproduct of such exploration is
            pragmatic knowledge, the disruption of standard patterns of thought, and also dealienation – you see what’s
            behind the interfaces that surround us, coming closer to the reality of our social world."</h3>
        <p>"The paragraph prompts me to think if the methodologies of hacking can also be applied to social design
            practices
            in order to dismantle the discriminatory convention and foster opportunities for reestablishment. By
            studying
            the nuances and the patterns behind the interface, we get to infiltrate the cracks in the facade. It also
            just
            reminds us the fact that hacking is not magic and it is conducted through a series of study and exploration.

            “The activist Luddite might break it in rebellion. But the hacker explores and then modifies the machine to
            make
            it self-destruct, or programmes it to frustrate the purpose of it owners, or opens its usage to those who do
            not
            own it. The hacker ethic is therefore a composite. It is not merely exploratory curiosity or rebellious
            deviance
            or creative innovation within incumbent systems. It emerges from the intersection of all three.”</h3>
        <p>
            It is poetic to think the gesture of hacking is the demolition of the artifacts rather than the human
            beings.
            The virtual destruction an be carried into the physical world and stifle the condition of the human subject.
            It
            is also an unconventional way of protest without physical violence. However, even though I understand the
            writer’s position, I wonder if they also consider the legitimacy of the hacking operations that hurts the
            most
            vulnerable demographic in the system.</p>

            “Nothing sinister about it: it’s just on-the-fly problem-solving for profit. This gentrified pitch is not
            just a
            cool personal narrative. It’s also a useful business construct, helping the tech industry to distinguish
            itself from the aggressive squares of Wall Street, competing for the same pool of new graduates.”</h3>
        <p>Even though I have heard much about how the internet is no longer a neutral space since it is still largely
            controlled by a handful of corporations, I never came across the proposition of that the ethos of hackers
            has been gentrified. And maybe everything has been gentrified. Art has been gentrified, designed has been
            gentrified. Everything that was once innovative and swaggy will be gentrified as soon as it was exposed to
            the mass population. The essence of the movement gets diluted as the incentive was contorted. Perhaps, the
            only way to combat gentrification is through resiliently reinventing and evolving. We mourned over the loss
            and enter another cycle of conquest and resurrrection.

        <h3>Why did Apple make a highly produced prototype when the previous examples show that a rapid paper storyboard or a
        sketchy interactive prototype were sufficient for designing a role and telling a usage story? The answer lies in the
        kind of audience.</h3>
        <p>It is interesting to think that the degree of elaboration of the prototype should also be determined by the audience. I
        also wonder about the possibility that a low budget client could be offended by a highly embellished prototype. In
        addition, what if the audience of the prototype is different from the target audience of the finish product? Could it
        pose a problem to the final design?</p><br><br>
        <h3>It was more efficient to wait on the results of independent investigations in the key areas of role, look and feel and
        implementation than to try to build a monolithic prototype that integrated all features from the start.</h3>
        <p>I always thought we should only make one prototype for one project, so it never occurs to me that we can actually build
        multiple and simpler version of them to communicate different aspects of the final product. It could also be easier to
        troubleshoot when we dissect the project into multiple parts.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Prototypes themselves do not necessarily communicate their purpose. It is especially important to clarify what is and
        what is not addressed by a prototype when presenting it to any audience beyond the immediate design team.</h3>
       <p>Since everyone has different expectations for what a prototype is, designers should prepare the audience for the purpose
        of the prototype. It could also pose much misunderstanding if the audience is unaware the main purpose of the prototype.
        However, I also wonder what should designers do in a situation that the audience’s expectation does not align with
        theirs? Also, what if the audience is too bogged down by the raw use-interface? Does it negate the purpose of the
        prototype?</p>
