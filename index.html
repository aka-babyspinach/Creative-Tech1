    <h1>"Such alternatives do not always replace the existing systems, nor are they often
        intended to. Instead, these material interventions provide insubstantiations of how the relationship between
        society and technology might be otherwise constructed."</h1>

    <p >It is really interesting that the writer bring up this point of open design alternatives
        are not here to replace the existing system rather than offering another possibility to it. Does design is
        defined as design when the intention is not trying to solve the problems? Moreover, what does it mean when an
        alternative or an open design offer an entirely possible and achievable solution, hence successfully replaced
        the existed system?</p>


    <h1> "Critical making, on the other hand, is less about the aesthetics AESTHETICS: 2D and
        politics of design work, and focuses instead on making practices themselves as processes of material and
        conceptual exploration."</h1>

    <p>I wonder how the writer define aesthetics in his article. In my opinion, aesthetics does
        not necessarily indicate having a beautiful and polished facade, but rather an appearance that communicates
        meanings and functions which sometimes happen to be aesthetically pleasing. In addition, even though I
        personally do not prefer the work that exclusively focus on design aesthetics, I cannot deny the power of style
        and trends, as well as how people are so easily swayed by attractive design aesthetics. Not to mention the fact
        that the “ intentionally unrefined ugly style” gradually comes in fashion as the trend of recent years.
        Therefore, I wonder if we can ever work pass the emphasis on aesthetics and exhibit our concept experimentation
        without considering the aesthetics of it. </p>


    <h1> "These are fine-edged distinctions and might cause some readers to wonder why it is
        necessary to define yet another term for yet another design-based methodology. In point of fact, much of the
        ongoing scholarly and technical work associated with critical making was initiated by discomfort around the
        dissonance of the term – why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical
        making’ seems odd to most of us?"</h1>

    <p>This quote really reflects what I have been contemplating recently. When a work of
        design is perfectly functional and beautiful, we often overlook the implication and the underlying context
        beyond its facade. Since we often confuse the good design with critical design, I think it is also important to
        draw the line between good design and critical design, but also where exactly should we draw the line. I also
        wonder what defines critical design? And can a design poses controversial even oppositional point of view be
        seen as critical design.

    <p>"It thus becomes an assertion of individual defiance of social norms. The byproduct of such exploration is
        pragmatic knowledge, the disruption of standard patterns of thought, and also dealienation – you see what’s
        behind the interfaces that surround us, coming closer to the reality of our social world."<br>
        The paragraph prompts me to think if the methodologies of hacking can also be applied to social design practices
        in order to dismantle the discriminatory convention and foster opportunities for reestablishment. By studying
        the nuances and the patterns behind the interface, we get to infiltrate the cracks in the facade. It also just
        reminds us the fact that hacking is not magic and it is conducted through a series of study and exploration.
        <br><br>
        “The activist Luddite might break it in rebellion. But the hacker explores and then modifies the machine to make
        it self-destruct, or programmes it to frustrate the purpose of it owners, or opens its usage to those who do not
        own it. The hacker ethic is therefore a composite. It is not merely exploratory curiosity or rebellious deviance
        or creative innovation within incumbent systems. It emerges from the intersection of all three.”<br>
        It is poetic to think the gesture of hacking is the demolition of the artifacts rather than the human beings.
        The virtual destruction an be carried into the physical world and stifle the condition of the human subject. It
        is also an unconventional way of protest without physical violence. However, even though I understand the
        writer’s position, I wonder if they also consider the legitimacy of the hacking operations that hurts the most
        vulnerable demographic in the system.
        <br><br>
        “Nothing sinister about it: it’s just on-the-fly problem-solving for profit. This gentrified pitch is not just a
        cool personal narrative. It’s also a useful business construct, helping the tech industry to distinguish itself
        from the aggressive squares of Wall Street, competing for the same pool of new graduates.”<br>
        Even though I have heard much about how the internet is no longer a neutral space since it is still largely
        controlled by a handful of corporations, I never came across the proposition of that the ethos of hackers has
        been gentrified. And maybe everything has been gentrified. Art has been gentrified, designed has been
        gentrified. Everything that was once innovative and swaggy will be gentrified as soon as it was exposed to the
        mass population. The essence of the movement gets diluted as the incentive was contorted. Perhaps, the only way
        to combat gentrification is through resiliently reinventing and evolving. We mourned over the loss and enter
        another cycle of conquest and resurrrection.
