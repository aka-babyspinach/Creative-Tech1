        <h3>"Such alternatives do not always replace the existing systems, nor are they often
            intended to. Instead, these material interventions provide insubstantiations of how the relationship between
            society and technology might be otherwise constructed."</h3>

        <p>It is really interesting that the writer bring up this point of open design alternatives
                are not here to replace the existing system rather than offering another possibility to it. Does design
                is
                defined as design when the intention is not trying to solve the problems? Moreover, what does it mean
                when an
                alternative or an open design offer an entirely possible and achievable solution, hence successfully
                replaced
                the existed system?</p></br>


        <h3> "Critical making, on the other hand, is less about the aesthetics AESTHETICS: 2D and
                politics of design work, and focuses instead on making practices themselves as processes of material and
                conceptual exploration."
        </h3>

        <p>I wonder how the writer define aesthetics in his article. In my opinion, aesthetics does
                    not necessarily indicate having a beautiful and polished facade, but rather an appearance that
                    communicates
                    meanings and functions which sometimes happen to be aesthetically pleasing. In addition, even though
                    I
                    personally do not prefer the work that exclusively focus on design aesthetics, I cannot deny the
                    power of style
                    and trends, as well as how people are so easily swayed by attractive design aesthetics. Not to
                    mention the fact
                    that the “ intentionally unrefined ugly style” gradually comes in fashion as the trend of recent
                    years.
                    Therefore, I wonder if we can ever work pass the emphasis on aesthetics and exhibit our concept
                    experimentation
                    without considering the aesthetics of it. 
        </p></br>


        <h3> "These are fine-edged distinctions and might cause some readers to wonder why it is
                    necessary to define yet another term for yet another design-based methodology. In point of fact,
                    much of the
                    ongoing scholarly and technical work associated with critical making was initiated by discomfort
                    around the
                    dissonance of the term – why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while
                    ‘critical
                    making’ seems odd to most of us?"</h3>

        <p>This quote really reflects what I have been contemplating recently. When a work of
                        design is perfectly functional and beautiful, we often overlook the implication and the
                        underlying context
                        beyond its facade. Since we often confuse the good design with critical design, I think it is
                        also important to
                        draw the line between good design and critical design, but also where exactly should we draw the
                        line. I also
                        wonder what defines critical design? And can a design poses controversial even oppositional
                        point of view be
                        seen as critical design.

        <h3>It thus becomes an assertion of individual defiance of social norms. The byproduct of such exploration is
            pragmatic knowledge, the disruption of standard patterns of thought, and also dealienation – you see what’s
            behind the interfaces that surround us, coming closer to the reality of our social world."</h3>
        <p>"The paragraph prompts me to think if the methodologies of hacking can also be applied to social design
            practices
            in order to dismantle the discriminatory convention and foster opportunities for reestablishment. By
            studying
            the nuances and the patterns behind the interface, we get to infiltrate the cracks in the facade. It also
            just
            reminds us the fact that hacking is not magic and it is conducted through a series of study and exploration.

            “The activist Luddite might break it in rebellion. But the hacker explores and then modifies the machine to
            make
            it self-destruct, or programmes it to frustrate the purpose of it owners, or opens its usage to those who do
            not
            own it. The hacker ethic is therefore a composite. It is not merely exploratory curiosity or rebellious
            deviance
            or creative innovation within incumbent systems. It emerges from the intersection of all three.”</h3>
        <p>
            It is poetic to think the gesture of hacking is the demolition of the artifacts rather than the human
            beings.
            The virtual destruction an be carried into the physical world and stifle the condition of the human subject.
            It
            is also an unconventional way of protest without physical violence. However, even though I understand the
            writer’s position, I wonder if they also consider the legitimacy of the hacking operations that hurts the
            most
            vulnerable demographic in the system.</p>

            “Nothing sinister about it: it’s just on-the-fly problem-solving for profit. This gentrified pitch is not
            just a
            cool personal narrative. It’s also a useful business construct, helping the tech industry to distinguish
            itself from the aggressive squares of Wall Street, competing for the same pool of new graduates.”</h3>
        <p>Even though I have heard much about how the internet is no longer a neutral space since it is still largely
            controlled by a handful of corporations, I never came across the proposition of that the ethos of hackers
            has been gentrified. And maybe everything has been gentrified. Art has been gentrified, designed has been
            gentrified. Everything that was once innovative and swaggy will be gentrified as soon as it was exposed to
            the mass population. The essence of the movement gets diluted as the incentive was contorted. Perhaps, the
            only way to combat gentrification is through resiliently reinventing and evolving. We mourned over the loss
            and enter another cycle of conquest and resurrrection.

        <h3>Why did Apple make a highly produced prototype when the previous examples show that a rapid paper storyboard or a
        sketchy interactive prototype were sufficient for designing a role and telling a usage story? The answer lies in the
        kind of audience.</h3>
        <p>It is interesting to think that the degree of elaboration of the prototype should also be determined by the audience. I
        also wonder about the possibility that a low budget client could be offended by a highly embellished prototype. In
        addition, what if the audience of the prototype is different from the target audience of the finish product? Could it
        pose a problem to the final design?</p><br><br>
        <h3>It was more efficient to wait on the results of independent investigations in the key areas of role, look and feel and
        implementation than to try to build a monolithic prototype that integrated all features from the start.</h3>
        <p>I always thought we should only make one prototype for one project, so it never occurs to me that we can actually build
        multiple and simpler version of them to communicate different aspects of the final product. It could also be easier to
        troubleshoot when we dissect the project into multiple parts.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Prototypes themselves do not necessarily communicate their purpose. It is especially important to clarify what is and
        what is not addressed by a prototype when presenting it to any audience beyond the immediate design team.</h3>
       <p>Since everyone has different expectations for what a prototype is, designers should prepare the audience for the purpose
        of the prototype. It could also ccause much misunderstanding if the audience is unaware the main purpose of the prototype.
        However, I also wonder what should designers do in a situation that the audience’s expectation does not align with
        theirs? Also, what if the audience is too bogged down by the raw user-interface? Does it negate the purpose of the
        prototype?</p></br>

        <h3>"Most importantly, the group of older people joined us in our exploration. Not only did they use the maps to point out
        locations we might search for sounds, but they joined us on our expedition into the countryside, helping us locate
        suitable sites for recording, negotiating with local farmers to give us access to the animals, and listening to the
        results with enjoyment."</h3>
        <p>Very often the most valuable part of an experiment is not whether we successfully execute a design, rather the
        connection we build with other people by interacting with them and listening to their stories. The degree of involvement
        and enthusiasm from the community cannot be forced, hence it is already a good start for any projects that involves
        designing for/with a community.</p></br>
        <h3>"People didn’t participate in the experiment simply because they were unaware that the experiment was going on".</h3>
        <p>I think a lot of times designers do not want to impose the experiments on their subject and rather wish the subjects
        respond to the experiment organically or without external forces. However, we often overestimate how much people are
        willing to participate when the design is not right in front of them, but it also raises the question of how we design
        to encourage people’s engagement. In addition, do we renounce our intention or do we keep it from our subjects? Are
        people willing to invest time and energy to participate and understand the design?</p></br>
        <h3>"In part, the success of the Bijlmer test was due to the lack of any technical failures. Beyond this, however, the
        situation in the Bijlmer presented us with more complex and richer issues than the other sites, and it was the success
        of the ideas to raise these social and cultural issues that convinced us to pursue the system further."</h3>
        <p>In the beginning of the chapter, the text also emphasized that the experiments adopts appropriate often low-tech means
        to simulate and test the experiences. I sometimes wonder why is it so hard to implement technology in community
        experiments. Is it because technology is too invasive? Or is it because the lack of infrastructure within the
        communities? Financial reasons could also be an issue, and within the community people’s literacy in certain technology
        definitely matters. However, if technology is the end goal of the experiment, how do we design appropriate means without
        technology to conduct the experiments? On the other hand, the experiment in Bijlmer shows that means of experiments does
        not have to elaborate. Ssimple gestures like presenting the slogans and interacting with the messages can do much in
        invoking people’s interest in participation.</p>

        <h3>Every month, code changes the world in some interesting, wonderful and disturbing way.</h3>
        <p>It is still crazy to me to think that all the aspects of our life is shaped by some sort of codes. The electronic
        appliances that we cannot live without, receiving a package, texting another person are composed of bits of code written
        by some people from the other of the world. We are shaped by the software and hardware around us, and we shape the
        software and hardware around us. Not a single person could code the entire Macintosh computer from scratch. Every
        program is a collective effort of a handful of people, and anyone who participates contributes.</p>
        <h3>Programming is debugging. It’s the expectation that things won’t work. This is not something people bring up, just like
        they don’t bring up their medical history on the first date.</h3>
        <p>I have always assumed that programming is an act of building and debugging only happens when things don’t work. Based on
        my extremely short experience in programming, so far I have experienced far more frustration than fulfillment as I spent
        most of the time debugging incompetently. When I learn how to code through youtube tutorials, writing codes just seem so
        easy and natural to the people on the screen as if debugging is atypicality. The red exclamation icon at the bottom of
        my text editor perpetuate my anxiety as I am learning. However, knowing that “programming is the expectation that things
        don’t work” provides me some reassurance and makes me feel less demoralizing.</p>
        <h3>Too much of what you know today will be useless in six months. Every hard-fought factoid about the absolute best and
        most principled way to use the language will be fetid zoo garbage by the end of the year.</h3>
        <p>Before I took my first computer science class in college, I thought I would be able to learn one programming language
        and roll with it for the rest of my life. I did not know programming language can go out of date and be replaced by new
        ones. In a way, we are not only learning how to code in a specific language, rather, we are learning how to learn a
        programming language so we have the ability to adapt and mutate. But right now, I am still struggling to fully
        understand one language and be able to create with lines of codes.</p>

        <h3>You would say, it is alive, since you have never seen a particle of dead matter move around quite like that.</h3>
        <p>There is something both eery and interesting about perceiving the machines with sensors as living creatures. We found no
        lack of evidence of how human beings anthropomorphize non organic matters in literature, design, art, commercial
        settings or whenever we construct narrative of things. It is quite poetic to describe machinery in such romantic and
        emotional language, however, it also manifests ho</p>
        <h3>Vehicle 2a is a coward, you would say. Not so Vehicle 2b. It, too, is excited by the presence of sources, but resolutely
        turns toward them and hits them with high velocity, as if it wanted to destroy them. Vehicle 2b is aggressive,
        obviously.</h3>
        <p>I love how the writer describe motions and behaviors the vehicles in this writing. He observes them like how animals are
        presented on planet earth, is it feels like we are reading some docuseries of some machine/animals. It also just gives
        me an idea like what if we can make digital ecology documentary later.</p>
        <h3>There is something very crude about a vehicle that can only excited by the thing it smells(or sees or feels or hears)
        and knows no soothing or relaxing stimuli.</h3>
        <p>It is a bit weird to think that a vehicle is stimulated by the smells, since at least to me sense of smell feels
        exclusive to living creatures with noses. Nevertheless, smell can be broken down into chemical composition just like how
        sounds can be broken down into sound waves or physics (please forgive my lack of knowledge and vocabulary this matter).
        I can’t help being fascinated by the sensor’s capability of processing abstract senses, feelings, and perceptions which
        seems so organic and unformulated. I also really like how the writer gives the vehicles some personality, so the
        machines are portrayed beyond simple living creatures as they have agency and preferences.</p>
